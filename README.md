This particular GitHub account will be used with association to my Wake Tech Community College enrollment. On here, you'll find additional repositories where practice code and activities reside.

This one specifically details the steps taken to create a repository, clone it, create some changes and then "commit" the file to my account.

In order to clone this repository, it was created on the web version of GitHub. Make sure to check the option where a "README" file is created at the same time. On the desktop version, the option to "clone" a repository was chosen and since the same account was used, the web browser version was available. Once selected, a local file was chosen for download.
